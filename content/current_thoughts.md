## Quantity always trumps quality

Just stumbled upon the idea of [quantity always trumping quality](https://blog.codinghorror.com/quantity-always-trumps-quality). Excited to try it out!

## Accelerated C++ (Dec. 2017)

Currently reading the book *Accelerated C++*.
It takes the approach of teaching you purely C++, rather than building on top of C knowledge.
While it isn't an exhaustive text, it claims to teach you the essentials.
Afterwards, it directs you to more complete texts as well as learning from more focused sources.

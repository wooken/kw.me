The lofty goals I set for myself seem to be the most fun to achieve. However, in the midst of the journey, I tend to focus too much on what I have yet to achieve, rather than what I have achieved so far.

I recently began to shift my focus to **acknowledging and celebrating the small successes**. And why the heck not? Even the seemingly tiniest of achievements are quite massive in their own right.

The resulting effect on my mood and motivation have been _quite positive_. And motivation can be difficult to come by at times.

So the next time I'm down about my best not being enough, I'm going to change my focus to what I have achieved on my journey, and give myself a nice pat on the back.

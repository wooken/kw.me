I recently went on a life-changing journey that I want to share.

It all started with the book *The Inner Game of Tennis by Timothy Gallwey*, which introduced me to a few ideas:

- learn to observe a result without emotional attachment
- attempting to consciously control every movement will result in stunted long-term skill development
- it is through attempting to micro-manage your movements during crunch time that causes your body to tense up resulting in the dreaded "choke"

It is not uncommon for people to overthink their movements in training or sport.
Therefore, the above ideas are worth exploring.

## Ineffective Zen

What does it mean to observe a result without emotional attachment?
According to the book, this means not to attribute *success* or *failure* to a given result.
The result just *is*.
You hit a ball out of bounds?
It's not *bad*, it just *is*.
You hit a killer serve?
It's not *good*, it just *is*.

Neat idea.
What happened when I tried to apply this at a competition?
**I became ineffective**.
Not only did I perform poorly, I was told it seemed I suddenly lacked passion.
As if I could not care less for my performance.
Odd.
Was this not the idea?
To attribute no emotion toward my performance?
Yet here I was, playing worse, rather than better.
I could not understand how to apply this idea to my game.
So for the time being, I reverted back to my old ways.

## Meditation?! Sounds Like Nonsense

Not so shortly after, I was introduced to another book, by my strength coach, called *10% Happier by Dan Harris*.
This book was an introduction to meditation from a skeptic's point of view.

"Meditation?", I thought.
"No, thank you", I told my coach, who was genuinely trying to help me.
After some urging and convincing on his part, and scouring of reviews on mine, I reluctantly picked up the book and gave it a shot.

## Mindfulness

After having read the book, I have not tried meditation yet.
However, the book did introduce me to an idea that I really liked: mindfulness.

Mindfulness is, to my understanding, being in the moment.
Not thinking about the past or the future.
Being in the present, and experiencing what is happening in the now.

That's all mumbo jumbo to me, so I rephrased it for myself.
The idea was to **focus, without distraction of past or future events**.
This means that regardless of results long passed, results that just happened, or results that may happen, you let go of those thoughts, and only focus on what is required of you this very moment.
**It doesn't matter if you lost at this competition a year ago, you had just lost an important play, or you're about to lose this game, the only thing that matters at this moment is the next play**.

I applied this to my game, and to my surprise, my average performance skyrocketed.
The most profound effect that this idea had was **I was no longer hindering my performance with negative self-talk**.
I became truly unfazed by impending losses, was able to play my best under the circumstances, and many times it resulted in miraculous comebacks.
On top of all this, I began to enjoy the stress of competition far more.

Then it hit me.
This was the missing piece of the puzzle.
It wasn't attributing success and failure to a result that was the hindrance, but allowing those thoughts to linger and affect subsequent performance.
For now, I could shrug off failed plays, celebrate successful plays with great emotion, and play every point stoically.
**And this is the most frightening thing for your opponent: when they cannot break you mentally, the burden is now on them to also not break**.
All the while, it doesn't matter to you if they're broken or not, it does not change your game either way.

## Closing Thoughts/tl;dr

The whimsically named *10% Happier* delivers on its title.
It taught me the idea of mindfulness, which solved the puzzle that is *The Inner Game of Tennis*.
For me, the end result is **being in a state of focus** and **diminished negative self-talk**.
Mindfulness has been pivotal to elevating my mental game, resulting in huge performance gains and, most importantly, remaining confident in myself in the absence of success.

## [Countdown until World Domination](http://kenwoo.me/countdown)

After receiving ACL surgery for my right knee, I was told to shoot for 1 whole year of gradual return to sport. This is merely to help me keep track of when it is time to profit.

## [MPT Log Generator](http://kenwoo.me/mptlog)

Used to perform formatting and calculations for daily exercise log entries for my coach at [MPT](http://www.moreiraperformance.com). Originally a command line tool written in Go. Rewritten so that other athletes on the team could use it as well.

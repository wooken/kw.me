title: "Busted Knee"

In the beginning of December 2017, I dislocated my right knee when pushing off to move forward during a beach volleyball game.

What a drag.

After a few visits to a physiotherapist and a sport medicine doctor, and eventually getting an MRI, it turns out I have a **torn ACL**.
I am told that I am a *good candidate* for **ACL reconstructive surgery**.
Either that or I quit any sport that could cause dislocation of the knee, further damaging adjacent structures.
As much as this is a great opportunity (read: excuse) to sit on my ass and play video games for the rest of my life, I'm far too stubborn to throw in the towel just yet.

I wanted to document this journey somehow.
What better place to do that than this ghost town of a blog that I don't write on and no one reads.

The goal as of right now is to **maintain strength** in the injured leg prior to surgery.
I'm told by the aforementioned health care professionals that staying strong will help facilitate faster recovery early in the process, or something to that effect.
At any rate, it sounds like a good deal.

And the long term goal?
To get back on the court at 100% capacity and surpass where I was before the injury occurred.
Will this be easy?
I have a faint idea that it won't be as easy as I'm hoping.
Let's see where this takes me.

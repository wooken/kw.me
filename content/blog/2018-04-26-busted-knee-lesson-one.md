On March 29, 2018, 1:15 AM, I had my MRI.
It's been just under 4 months since the original injury.
Rehab in the gym had been going great.
I was not only maintaining strength, I was getting stronger than before.
And only a week ago, I tried to play some very recreational indoor volleyball to tested my leg out.
I was a friggin rock-star.
Okay not really, I took it easy but was able to jump confidently.

On the same day as the MRI, I'm asked to play in indoor volleyball men's league finals.
I haven't played in this league for over a year, and had barely touched a ball since the injury.

Naturally, I said hold my beer, I'm going to go play.

Idiot.

The first match came down to the wire, and on the last few points, I made the exact same defensive maneuver (pushed off of the right knee) and dislocated the knee.

I'll say it again -- idiot.

I fell over, wincing in pain like a pansy and had to get carried off the court.
I had vastly overestimated my readiness to get back on the court.
Never mind the fact that I did not even bother to consult a physiotherapist before playing.

And that's when it hit me: the toughest part of this entire journey will be **discipline**.

The discipline to *take it slow*, *do less*, *wait*.

The surgeon tells me it takes 6-12 months for the knee ligament to remodel and become functional.
The longer I wait to attempt to play at full capacity, the lower the chance of the new ligament failing.

That's a long time to wait.
That's a long time to rehab and train without the ability to play.
Will I be determined enough?
Will I love the sport enough?
These questions will be answered in the next year.
